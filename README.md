# python-docx-ng

*python-docx-ng* is a Python library for creating and updating Microsoft Word (.docx) files.
It was originally designed and developed by [scanny](https://github.com/scanny) as [python-docx](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx).
As he is not actively developing his repo and there are soo many useful pull requests, bringing together a more powerful tool.
This repo should merge a lot of those things and create a more powerful version, hopefully bearing the original structure of scanny in mind.

More information is available in the [python-docx-ng Documentation](https://python-docx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
